**Run Plugin**
1. Fix root project dir in **Settings.kt**
1. $ `./gradlew :sampler-plugin:runIde`

**Run Sampler Service**  
Probably you haven't access to [KSamples App](https://github.com/settings/apps/kotlin-sample).
So you can create your own app. 
For receiving notifications from GitHub you can use [smee.io](https://smee.io/).

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 from [here](https://developer.github.com/apps/quickstart-guides/setting-up-your-development-environment).
1. Set up security.github.token at `resources/application.conf` 
1. $ `./gradlew :sampler-service:run`

**More about the service**  
Libraries: KTor, Kotlinx-serialization
The service gets notification from GitHub App and runs a special pipeline.  
Pipeline is a special KTor object. It can contains one or many phases. And in phase you can run another pipeline.  
For example: A notification with header "x-github-event: installation" runs a pipeline which add a sample to the system.
Consider the basic steps.  
Pipeline 1.

1. Split on repositories. Author of a sample can install GitHub App for all or several repositories.
Therefore, at this phase we parallelize the addition to each repository. 


Pipeline 2.

1. Create an issue in *ksamples/main*
2. Create a card in project board
3. Fork a sample repository
4. Prepare test. 
    Here we have one or many branches in the repository. So we run new pipeline for each branch

Pipeline 3.

1. Test branch

For event **push** we should create new pull request (if it doesnâ€™t exist before) and test it. But this part is unimplemented.
